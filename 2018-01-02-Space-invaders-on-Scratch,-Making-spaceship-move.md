    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started of with some code on Scratch and a spaceship on our screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>Our target for our lesson was  to make our spaceship move left and right across the screen and to make it shoot.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I was able to reach the target by the lesson and I made the spaceship move left and right and shoot as well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>During the time we had to make the spaceship move, I wasn't able to make it move smoothly across the screen and not to wait before it moved. Eventually after a lot of thinking and using different codes I worked out the answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I didn't Question much this week as I expected to however I asked " What makes the ship move but with a little break before?"  and eventually I got my answer which was it needed time for the code to get to the spaceship before it moves across our screen. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td> During our lesson I was independent when I couldn't find out how to make the ship move swiftly across my screen, I was independent and worked out the problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>When I looked back on all my work I did at my old school I used those skills and put it in my work to help me.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged with in the lesson by paying attention when the teacher was speaking and that helped me to do my work in that lesson.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The lesson would have gone better if I’d finished the basics in the coding on time and earlier so I had more time to improve on it and make the work on Scratch so I wasn’t behind on work</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The changes that I need to for our next lesson is that I have to get the basic coding done right and then move on to the extended pieces of work to make it better.</td>
