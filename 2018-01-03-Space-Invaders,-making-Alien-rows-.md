  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had a worksheet on our screen and had our code from our previous lesson on making the Spaceship move on Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for that lesson was to make our way through the worksheet in order for the aliens to be created and to move across the screen.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I wasn't able to reach my target by the lesson as I didn’t manage to  get through the worksheet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>During the time we were working through the worksheet, my aliens were not coming out on the screen in row  and they were hidden behind each other and were dotted across the screen in different places. So I kept on trying until I was able to  find the answer and to sort it out.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I was questioning during this task as, when I had finnish the worksheet there was still a problem with my code so I question myself if I had copied out the worksheet in the right way and in the right order.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>During the lesson I noticed that my aliens weren't lined up in rows and that they were staggered on top of each other, I was independent at this moment of time as I checked through my coding to find any problems until I found out the answer and I didnt ask for any help and just got through it myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>After I had figured out the problem my code started working on Scratch and my aliens were all moving in a line, I looked back on the work that I had done during the lesson and I was all up to standed with others in my form.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged a lot throughout this lesson as I payed attention to the teacher and followed through the instructions that I was told to do, if I hadn't of payed attention I wouldn’t have been able to find the worksheet and I would have not been able to find the correct code in order to make the aliens move in rows. </td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have listened to what Mr Keen said about us having to use our own skills to work some problems out and because I didnt I lost a lot of time on this task because I was asking questions on why this wasn’t working and what I needed to do. However when I looked on the sheet the answers were already right in front of me and I just wasn’t reading through the sheet propally.</td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I can improve on my work next time if I listen and engage to what Mr Keen is saying and thet  next time I need to use my own skills through the lesson and not just ask questions on why my piece of coding isn’t working. I also need to read the instruction propally on the worksheet and be a little more independent.</td>
