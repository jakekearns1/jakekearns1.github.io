  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started of by making a Scratch account and test out different codes for our Scratch character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To play around with Scratch and learns new ways to code Scratch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I managed to reach my target however I wasn't able to find as many new ways to code Scratch then I thought I should have.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Trying to fix my coding when I broke the code, until it started working again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>Thinking what would happen if I added a new code and if it would work or not.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I found out that if you go onto the characters detail you could rotate in the direction you want the character to go.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Putting what I already knew about Scratch and adding it into my code and improving it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was engaging into the challenge by focussing on the work I was doing and playing attention to find knew codes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It would have gone better if I found more knew codes and if I managed to get my Scratch character to move by touching the up, down , left, right keys.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It would have gone better if I looked through each type of code category to find the type of code to add in for the character to make it move by the keys. </td>
