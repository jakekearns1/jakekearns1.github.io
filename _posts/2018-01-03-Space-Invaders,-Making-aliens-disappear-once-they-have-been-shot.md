    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had some code from all previous lesson on Scratch.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>The target for this lesson on Scratch was to make our Aliens disappear once they've been shot by the Spaceship and also make a score appear  on the screen after the alien disappear.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I was able to reach my target this lesson as I made the Aliens disappear once shot however I wasn't able to finish the extension which was to make a score appear on the screen once Alien had been shot but I was very close to finishing.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered through this task in the lesson as I got stuck on the code which made the Alien disappear once shot, so i kept  on thinking and going through instructions in my had that we were told at the start of the lesson. I kept on naging my brain for an answer until I found the code. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I question myself through this task when my bullet was hitting the Alien it wasn't making the Alien disappear and the Bullet was going straight through each Alien and not disappearing itself. I questioned myself why this  was happening until I realised I hadn’t told the Bullet to hide once it hit the Alien and I also hadn’t told the Alien to hide once the Bullet hit it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independant through this task during the lesson  as when I couldn’t work out why the Bullet wasn’t disappearing once it hit the Alien and also why the Alien wasn’t disappearing as well, I had to work my way through the problem myself and eventually I worked the problem out without any help and I just put my own skills to the test which helped me throughout this situation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I have been looking back on my work lately and I have seen that I have been improving and learning new skills throughout the time I’ve been on Scratch at school. I have also been pleased with the progress I have got through.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged during the lesson because I was paying attention to what Mr Keen was telling us and I was talking to the person sat next to me and just got on with task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>During my learning it could have gone better if I had work a little faster so that I could have time to make  thescore appear on the screen. This would of helped me alot as I wouldn’t have to finish it of  next lesson and it would save time during next lesson as well.</td>
    <td></td>

  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The changes that I need to make for next lesson are that I need to work just a little  faster so I don’t get caught on time and so I don’t have to finish of work at home and also to listen a little more to instructions as that would save time thinking about what I’ve broken in the codes.</td>
